### Who are Sequensis?

We are the development and test team for [Oakbrook Finance](https://www.oakbrookfinance.com/),
based in Nottingham.

### What this repo is for?

This repo is a place for our development and coding standards. Patterns we use in our system,
why we have chosen to go that way, tools that we use and how we use them, anything that we 
have as a standard. 

This repo is used as a "source of truth" for these standards. It is to spawn discussion on whether
our ways of doing things are the right way, and as a reference for when they are needed.
